# This a DAG-Based Consensus implementation
## Client
this a p2p node based on libp2p
## Design Plan
* STEP 1 
a p2p network with 2 normal nodes and 1 byzantine node
* STEP 2
a p2p network with 6 normal nodes and 2 byzantine node
## TODO LIST
1. p2p network with 100 nodes (completed)
2. every node can publish and subscribe msgs at the same time (completed)
3. draw the directed-acyclic-graph with the log of one node 
3. join less than 1/3 byzantine node
4. make consensus on the DAG
